When it comes to javascript in the browser, speed is where its at.  Who needs a library that takes, like, 50ms to load.  That stuff is so 2013.  Welcome to the future, [vapor.js](http://vaporjs.com) is here.  Vapor is so fast and lightweight you won't even know it's there.  It gets out of your way and lets you focus on building something cool.

### How do I use it?
check out their [website](http://vaporjs.com/), [repo](https://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js), [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9545348/whats-the-javascript-framework-that-works-best-in-ie),[quora](http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-started-with-vapor-js), or just google it.

### Want to contribute?
The folks running the vapor.js project liberally include pull requests into their code base, so start hacking it.  Vapor started as a grass roots project and stays that way today.  Keep pushing it forward!  Never mind the noobs who don't get it.
