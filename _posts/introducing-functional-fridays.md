Technical Hipster is proud to introduce Functional Fridays, a day of the week to contemplate and celebrate the [Haskells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29), [ML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29)'s, and [Lisps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29) of the world.  If we think of something sufficiently thought-provoking, you'll find it posted here (on a Friday, of course).
