I remember a day, back in the *Good Ol' Days*, when I knew what was going on.  I remember a time, a simpler time, when I could just understand the landscape.  It was so easy.

What's wrong with Python?  It's practically English.  'Hello World' is just `print 'Hello World'`!  And they have a sense of humor.  You can `import 'antigravity'` and it'll open up the [relevant XKCD](http://xkcd.com/353/) in your browser of choice.  

Or what about Ruby?  That's almost English too.  I mean, it's closer to Yoda than English, but still.  Rails might be an enormous monstrosity of a framework where the API is nigh-unreadable and figuring out how to do what you want (instead of what it wants) is an exercise in futility, but at least [it scales](http://canrailsscale.com/)!  

Now you kids are out on my lawn, with your [skinny jeans](https://github.com/jotto/skinny_jeans) and your [moustaches](http://mustache.github.io/) and your [latte's](http://coffeescript.org/) and your [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).  And everybody wants to hang out with some guy named [Jason](http://www.json.org/).  

Because I like order and structure so much (being a square, as I am), I leave you with this- [The Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/coreyflynn).
