Nominally, I'm a Biologist.  That makes sense given that I spent a decade of my life in school studying biology and its best friends.  Being trained at a tech school, I learned a thing or two about building tools to automate handling biological data (mostly because I'm lazy and don't like doing the same thing over and over again).  So, I ended up writing code for a living and writing that code surrounded mostly by people who have no formal training or interest in software engineering.  Worse yet, some of them act as though they have [no idea what I do all day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkwrIZQDt50).  Where does this leave us?  A lot of my job consists of prototyping stuff that my colleagues don't even know is possible.  How hipster is that?  

I end up generating a lot of quick prototypes and just sort of keep them around in case they end up being of use down the road.  Most of the time these things don't get released anywhere other than places I know of or that I can access (BTW, its pretty easy to sell [security through obscurity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) to biologists).  I try to keep all of them at my fingertips though in case they fit the bill for a given situation. 

For example, people sometimes ask me, "Hey, has your lab done experiment **X**"?  Inside I'm thinking "Are you crazy, we've done 1.3 million experiments in the past two years, I don't keep track of the one you care about".  Outside, I stay calm and [pull out my phone](http://cuantohipster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/business-casual-hipster-moda-look-wtf-ridiculo-hortera1.jpg).  I pop open an iOS app prototype I built and look it up for them.  As soon as they see this

![WTF is that, how do I get me some!](/images/posts/hipsterPrototype/pert_search_type.png)

they go nuts.  It's about the most straight forward iOS app you can build with a few list views backed by an SQLite database, but to them it's magic.  It's at this point that my colleagues see the future and must have this app on their phone.  

"Who wrote that?" "How do I get it on the app store?"  I say, "Oh this thing? I just built it because I was bored on a train ride. I don't think I'll release it. You think it's useful? I just use it sometimes when I'm on the go."  Instant street cred.  They don't know what I do or really understand it, but now they think it's cool.  Wool over eyes.

> This app is so cool it only exists on my phone

I call this hipster prototyping.  They didn't know about it. It's cool, but I act like I'm over it.  Colleagues leave the conversation with a vague sense that something sweet is happening but they don't know what.
